**Analyse-Multidimensionnelle-du-Conflit-Palestine-Isra-l-Construction-d-un-Tableau-de-Bord-Dynamique**
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on the multidimensional analysis of the Palestine-Israel conflict through the construction of a dynamic dashboard. It covers the entire data pipeline, from data extraction and cleaning to visualization and predictive modeling.

**Key Steps**
1. **Data Extraction:**

The data was collected using web scraping techniques. Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium were used to scrape relevant data, which can be found in the Scrapping folder.
Data Preparation and Cleaning:
2.**data cleaning and processing:**
For data cleaning and processing, Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) was utilized. PDI was essential in transforming the raw data into a usable format for further analysis.
Data Visualization:
3.**Visualizing the Data:**
The cleaned data was visualized using Power BI, providing insights into various aspects of the conflict through interactive dashboards.
4.**Predictive Modeling:**

In addition to visualization, a basic predictive model was created using WEKA. A simple linear regression model was built to forecast the number of Palestinian refugees in the upcoming year, based on the collected data.
